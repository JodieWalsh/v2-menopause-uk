            <strong>Key Guidelines:</strong><br>
            â€¢ <strong>Ages 40-44:</strong> Screening available, discuss with your doctor<sup style="color: #d63384;">[2]</sup><br>
            â€¢ <strong>Ages 45-54:</strong> Annual mammograms recommended (ACS)<sup style="color: #d63384;">[2]</sup><br>
